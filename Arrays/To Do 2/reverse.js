//Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second array â€“ move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().

function reverse(array) {
    for (var i = 0; i < array.length/2; i ++) {
        var temp = array[i];
        array[i] = array[array.length - 1 - i];
        array[array.length - 1 - i] = temp
    }

    console.log(array)
}

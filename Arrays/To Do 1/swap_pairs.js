// BONUS: Swap positions of successive pairs of values of given array. If length is odd, do not change the final element. For [1,2,3,4], return [2,1,4,3]. For example, change input ["Brendan",true,42] to [true,"Brendan",42]. As with all array challenges, do this without using any built-in array methods.
